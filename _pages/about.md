My name is Lei Zhao, and I obtained my Ph.D. in Computer Science and Technology in 2024. I am very fortunate to be advised by Prof. Xiangke Liao and Prof. Kenli Li of Intelligent Ultrasound Lab, Hunan University. In 2022, I was a visiting student at the Chinese University of Hong Kong and the National University of Singapore, the collaborative supervisors are Prof. Hongliang Ren and Dr. Chwee Ming Lim. I obtained my Master's degree in 2020 under the supervision of Prof. Yong Dou at the National University of Defense Technology. My research interests primarily focus on artificial intelligence and medical image analysis, aiming to enhance clinical workflows and diagnostics through intelligent ultrasound scanning systems.
